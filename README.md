# Enigma Machine Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the Enigma machine, an encryption device used during World War II, written in C++. The program allows users to configure various settings, including the plugboard, rotors, and reflectors, to encrypt messages.

## Features

- **Plugboard Configuration**: Connect letters to enhance encryption complexity.
- **Rotor Selection**: Choose from five rotors (I, II, III, IV, V) with customizable initial positions (1-26) and ring settings (A-Z).
- **Reflector Options**: Select between two reflectors (B and C) to alter the encryption pattern.
- **Message Encryption**: Input plaintext messages and receive the encrypted output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, for building with CMake)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Christopher-Toth/enigma-machine.git
   cd enigma-machine
